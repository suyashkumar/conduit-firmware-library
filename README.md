# conduit-firmware-library
Use magical RESTful APIs from a central server to communicate to/from the ESP8266 chip with ease!

This is the firmware library that goes along with the [conduit](https://github.com/suyashkumar/conduit) framework. It allows you to use secure RESTful APIs to call arbitrary functions on your ESP8266 chip from the central https://conduit.suyash.io server. It also allows you to send arbitrary data from your ESP8266 chip to the central conduit server.
